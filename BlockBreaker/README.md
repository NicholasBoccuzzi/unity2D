# Blockbreaker

Blockbreaker is my first attempt at using C# and building a 2D game through Unity that has interactable physics. The game consists of a two different levels, a start screen, game over screen and a victory screen. When inactive for 10 seconds, the game automatically plays a demo of the first level and will continue the loop until a button is pressed. Blockbreaker incorporates a custom background beat and sound effects when the ball hits the bouncepad and the different colored bricks. The bricks, ball and bouncepad were made using a sprite editor called, Aseprite.
